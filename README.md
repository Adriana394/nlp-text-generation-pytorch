# Model-based Text Generation Project with Hugging Face Transformers
This repository contains an example project for model-based text generation using the *Hugging Face Transformers* library with a Causal Language Model (CLM). The project demonstrates how to load a pre-trained CLM and use it to generate continuous text based on input prompts.

Before running the code, make sure to have the following dependencies installed:

*Python* (recommended version 3.x)

*PyTorch* (version corresponding to your CUDA version if available)

*Hugging Face Transformers library*

## Usage
*Load Model and Tokenizer*: The example uses a pre-trained model (gpt2-xl) and its corresponding tokenizer. The model will be automatically downloaded from the Hugging Face model hub.

*Text Generation*: The code demonstrates how to use the loaded model to generate text predictions. The input is used as part of a prompt-based text generation process.

## Customization
*Replace Model*: You can replace the model with another one available in the Hugging Face model hub, e.g., *gpt2*, *gpt2-medium*, *gpt2-large*, etc.

*Adjust Parameters*: Experiment with different model parameters like max_length, num_return_sequences, and num_beams to control text generation.
